"""Multi-version negotiation matrix (raw QUIC).

A client offering several drafts settles on the server's draft via ALPN:
the client offers every supported ALPN newest-first, the single-draft
server confirms its one ALPN, and the client locks its draft from the
TLS-negotiated value (version-from-ALPN). The session never touches the
process — each session's draft is its own.

Both transports negotiate in-band: raw QUIC via the ALPN list
(version-from-ALPN) and WebTransport via WT-Available-Protocols ->
WT-Protocol (version-from-negotiated-protocol). WT pinned-draft
handshakes are also covered by test_loopback_setup.
