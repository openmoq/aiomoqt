"""ERSATZ-RELAY — a stand-in MoQT relay, not a production relay.

It genuinely relays (moxygen's moqtest conformance suite gates our CI
against it), but it exists for exactly two purposes:

  1. exercise aiomoqt's server-role API surface end to end, and
  2. stand as the SUT for conformance and interop harnesses.

Deliberately absent, and staying absent:

  * NO authentication, authorization, or rate limiting
  * NO load handling, bounded queues, or production hardening
  * NO group cache, so a late subscriber sees only what arrives next,
    and joining FETCH is not served
  * NO forward-state propagation (REQUEST_UPDATE Forward=0/1 upstream)
  * NO delivery-timeout enforcement
  * Namespace tables are in-memory and global to the process

Routing model (cross-session, single relay instance):
  - PUBLISH_NAMESPACE: record the announcing session under the
    namespace tuple, respond with the protocol's default RequestOk
    (d16+) / PublishNamespaceOk (d14).
  - SUBSCRIBE: find publishers that announced the namespace or a prefix
    of it (§2.4 Namespace Prefix Matching), subscribe upstream once per
    Full Track Name, answer SUBSCRIBE_OK and fan the objects out to
    every downstream subscriber of that track. With no match, send
    SUBSCRIBE_ERROR / REQUEST_ERROR with TRACK_DOES_NOT_EXIST (d14 code
    0x04, d16+ code 0x10) so a conformance suite sees a spec-correct
    rejection.
  - PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_DONE: drop that session's hold on the namespace.

Run on UDP/4443 with the runner's /certs convention:

  python -m aiomoqt.tools.moq_interop_relay \\
      --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 4443 \\
      --cert /certs/cert.pem --key /certs/priv.key

Transports: WebTransport by default, raw QUIC with `--quic`, or BOTH
on one port with `--dual` (per-connection ALPN dispatch via aiopquic
serve_dispatch). `--quic-port N` remains as the legacy two-listener
arrangement (second raw-QUIC listener sharing the global namespace
table) for runners that expect distinct endpoints.
